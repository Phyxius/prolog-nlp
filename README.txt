CS427: Prolog Natural Language Processing
Shea Polansky and Robert Spidle

How to run - Context Sensitive:
In the prolog prompt, type "[context_sensitive,lexicon_final].", followed by a newline. After that, enter sentences you wish to parse in the form "utterance([first-word, second-word, ... last-word]).". The program will output "true" if the sentence is grammatically correct, and false otherwise.

How to run - Probabilistic:
In the prolog prompt, type "[probabilistic,lexicon_final].", followed by a newline. After that, enter sentences you wish to parse in the form "utterance(Prob, [first-word, second-word, ... last-word]).". The program will output "Prob = <probability>" if the sentence is grammatically correct, and false otherwise.

Notes:
-The program uses the same lexicon (lexicon_final.pl) for both versions; it will ignore either the probability or the subject/verb agreement portions of the data as appropriate.
-The program will successfully parse the final sentence in example_sentences.pl; however, execution time on my machine was approximately 2.5 hours.
-The process for building the final lexicon was as follows: First, prepositions were added to the file lexicon_original.pl, forming lexicon_updated.pl. Then the Python script generate-probabilities.py was run (generate-probabilities.py lexicon_updated.pl lexicon_final.pl) to automatically generate random probabilities for each word. Probabilities within each category (noun, verb, etc.) add up to 1.
-The file traces.txt is generated by the script generate-trace.sh
